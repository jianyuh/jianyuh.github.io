Several insights are drawn from [Staff Engineer: Leadership beyond the management track](https://staffeng.com/book). A good summary is available on [this page](https://github.com/mgp/book-notes/blob/master/staff-engineer.markdown#staff-projects).

### Communication in Engineering:
- Modern engineering involves diverse communication methods: emails, workplace chat messages, documents, comments, PR reviews, meetings, and interviews.
- Communication styles vary by company but generally aim for simplicity, directness, precision, efficiency, transparency, and professionalism. This can sometimes feel harsh and stressful.

### Challenges and Trade-offs:
- Every theory and solution has its limits and trade-offs.
- You'll encounter people who focus on trivial details or provide unhelpful feedback.
- Remember that colleagues are people first and may have bad days.

### Documentation:
- Complaints about lack of documentation are common.
- Documentation comes in many forms, including code, word of mouth, and digital tools.
- Understanding documentation can be a difficult process.

### Arguments and Evidence:
- Avoid arguments without data or a compelling story.
- Convincing others requires evidence or experience.

### Office Politics:
- At times, a point you raise may be dismissed, only to be accepted when presented by someone else due to their seniority, experience, or connections. This is known as office politics.
- Avoid relying on political tactics to influence others when you have the power to do so, as it can backfire. Instead, try to persuade with evidence and technical reasoning.

### Growth and Risk-taking:
- Growth comes from taking risks and facing challenges.
- Working for a big company reduces risk but also potential growth.
- Making mistakes and solving problems are essential for development.

### Management and Decision-making:
- As you gain experience, you'll take on more decision-making roles.
- Avoid micromanagement and allow others to learn from mistakes.

### Ownership and Collaboration:
- Effective systems are often automated and self-service.
- Strong ownership should not hinder knowledge sharing and collaboration.

### Peer Reviews and Competition:
- Peer reviews and collaboration are crucial, but colleagues are also competitors.
- Balancing being non-threatening and useful to colleagues is a lifelong challenge.

### Company Culture:
- Companies may promote a family-like atmosphere, but the goal is to create value.
- Personal success and well-being are important but serve the company's interests.

### Occupational Hazards:
- Burnout, anxiety, and other mental health issues are common in the industry.
- Legal protections vary, and some frameworks may not adequately protect employees.

### Long-term Perspective:
- Focus on the long game.
- Health is your greatest asset, and time is your best ally for returns.
