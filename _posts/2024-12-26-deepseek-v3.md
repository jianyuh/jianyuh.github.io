### Summary

DeepSeek-V3: a 671B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) language model with 37B parameters activated per token.
DeepSeek-V3 builds upon the successes of its predecessors, DeepSeek-V2 and DeepSeek-V2.5, incorporating several key innovations:

- Architecture:
    - Employs Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) for efficient inference and reduced Key-Value cache.
    - Utilizes an enhanced DeepSeekMoE architecture with an auxiliary-loss-free strategy for load balancing, minimizing performance degradation while encouraging expert specialization.
    - Introduces a Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) objective, predicting multiple future tokens for improved data efficiency and potential for speculative decoding.

- Training:
    - Employs a novel DualPipe algorithm for efficient pipeline parallelism with reduced pipeline bubbles and computation-communication overlap.
    - Utilizes efficient cross-node all-to-all communication kernels, maximizing bandwidth utilization.
    - Supports FP8 mixed-precision training for accelerated training and reduced memory usage.
    - Implements memory optimizations, eliminating the need for costly tensor parallelism.

- Pre-training:
    - Trained on a massive, diverse, and high-quality dataset comprising 14.8 trillion tokens.
    - Demonstrates remarkable stability throughout the training process.
    - Incorporates a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) strategy for improved bidirectional context understanding.
    - Features a two-stage context length extension process, enabling handling of inputs up to 128K tokens.

- Post-training:
    - Includes Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) stages to align with human preferences.
    - Employs a novel knowledge distillation methodology from the DeepSeek-R1 series, enhancing reasoning capabilities while maintaining output style and length.
    - Utilizes DeepSeek-V3 itself as a generative reward model during RL, further improving alignment and performance.

DeepSeek-V3 excels across various benchmarks, including:
- Knowledge: Outperforms other open-source models on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SimpleQA, and Chinese SimpleQA.
- Code, Math, and Reasoning: Achieves state-of-the-art results on coding competition benchmarks (LiveCodeBench), math benchmarks (MATH-500), and exhibits robust performance on engineering tasks (SWE-Bench).

DeepSeek-V3 sets a new standard for open-source language models, achieving comparable performance to leading closed-source models while maintaining economical training costs ($5.576M). The report concludes by highlighting limitations, primarily related to deployment scale and speed, and outlines future research directions, including:
- Further architectural refinements for efficiency and infinite context length support.
- Exploring alternative architectures beyond the Transformer.
- Developing more general and scalable reward methods for RL.
- Expanding multilingual capabilities and cultural awareness.

### MLA vs. MHA vs. MQA

Multi-head latent attention (MLA) is a core component of the DeepSeek-V3 architecture, designed for efficient inference and reduced memory consumption. It achieves this through low-rank joint compression of attention keys and values, minimizing the Key-Value (KV) cache required during text generation.
Here's a breakdown of the key differences between MLA and other attention mechanisms:
Multi-Head Attention (MHA):
- Standard attention mechanism in Transformer models.
- Computes attention scores for each head independently, resulting in a larger KV cache during generation.
Multi-Query Attention (MQA):
- An efficient variant of MHA where queries are projected independently, while keys and values are shared across heads.
- Reduces the number of parameters and computations compared to MHA.
- Still requires caching all keys and values for generation.

Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA):
- Introduces low-rank compression for both keys and values, producing a significantly smaller latent representation.
- Only the compressed latent vectors and decoupled keys (carrying positional information) need to be cached during generation.
- Results in substantial KV cache reduction while maintaining performance comparable to MHA.
In essence, MLA in DeepSeek-V3 addresses the memory bottleneck associated with large context lengths by compressing the key and value representations, allowing for efficient inference without sacrificing model performance. This makes it particularly well-suited for large language models like DeepSeek-V3 that are designed to handle long and complex inputs.


### FP8 Training Recipes

DeepSeek-V3 utilizes a meticulously designed FP8 mixed-precision training framework to accelerate training and reduce memory usage. Here's a breakdown of the key FP8 recipes employed:
1. Mixed Precision Framework:
- DeepSeek-V3 strategically employs FP8 for compute-intensive operations, such as General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs) in the forward and backward passes for linear layers. This theoretically doubles the computational speed compared to BF16.
- Operators sensitive to low-precision computations, such as the embedding module, output head, MoE gating, normalization, and attention operators, retain their original precision (BF16 or FP32) for stability.
- Master weights, gradients, and optimizer states are maintained in higher precision (FP32 or BF16) to ensure numerical stability.

2. Fine-grained Quantization:
- Tile-wise quantization for activations (1x128 tiles) and block-wise quantization for weights (128x128 blocks) ensure more accurate representation of values and better handling of outliers, mitigating the limited dynamic range of FP8.
- Per-group scaling factors along the inner dimension of GEMM operations are introduced to further enhance quantization accuracy.

3. Increased Accumulation Precision:
- To address the potential underflow issues in FP8 GEMM, DeepSeek-V3 employs precise FP32 accumulation. This contrasts with some FP8 frameworks that use limited-precision accumulation within Tensor Cores, leading to greater errors, especially with large inner dimensions.

4. Mantissa over Exponents:
- DeepSeek-V3 consistently uses the E4M3 (4-bit exponent, 3-bit mantissa) format for all tensors, prioritizing mantissa precision over the exponent range. This is made feasible by the fine-grained quantization strategy.

5. Online Quantization:
- DeepSeek-V3 employs online quantization where scaling factors and quantization are performed for each tile or block on-the-fly. This ensures accurate scaling based on the current data distribution, simplifying the framework.

6. Low-Precision Storage and Communication:
- Optimizer states use BF16 instead of FP32 for tracking the first and second moments without impacting performance.
- Activations are cached in FP8, further reducing memory consumption. However, certain activations crucial for precision, such as those used in attention and MoE layers, utilize a customized E5M6 format or remain in BF16.
- Activations are quantized to FP8 before MoE up-projection and activation gradients are quantized to FP8 before MoE down-projection, minimizing communication overhead.

These combined strategies allow DeepSeek-V3 to leverage the benefits of FP8 training – accelerated computation and reduced memory footprint – while maintaining comparable accuracy to higher precision training. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated in ablation studies, where FP8 training exhibits a relative loss error consistently below 0.25% compared to the BF16 baseline.


### MoE Architecture Configurations

DeepSeek-V3 employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for its Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), utilizing a total of 257 experts per MoE layer. This includes:
- 1 shared expert: This expert is accessible to all tokens.
- 256 routed experts: These experts are selectively activated based on the input tokens. For each token, only 8 routed experts are activated, determined by the token-to-expert affinity scores.
Therefore, for each token processed by an MoE layer, a total of 9 experts (1 shared + 8 routed) contribute to the computation.

It's important to note that, while DeepSeek-V3 activates 8 routed experts per token, the system's design allows it to scale up to 13 experts per token (4 nodes × 3.2 experts/node) without incurring additional communication overhead. This scalability is achieved through efficient cross-node communication strategies that prioritize NVLink transfers within nodes.
