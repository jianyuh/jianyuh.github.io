### Youth: The First Encounter

Before high school, the sea was a distant myth to me. I still vividly recall a social practice trip where we cycled for two hours from my high school to reach the coast. When our wheels finally came to a halt by the Yellow Sea, the rhythmic roar of the tide and the boundless blue horizon left an indelible mark on my soul. It was my first true encounter with the concept of "infinity"—a sudden realization of how vast the world is, and how small we are within it.

### University: Reflections in the Harbor

During my university years, the sea became a shifting backdrop for my growth. While visiting various universities in Hong Kong, I stood by the shores of Clear Water Bay near HKUST and watched the neon lights of the city shimmer on the deep waters of Victoria Harbour. It was a striking fusion of modern ambition and raw natural power. Upon graduation, I traveled to the Bohai Sea at Beidaihe. Standing there, the salt air seemed to carry away the bittersweetness of parting, replacing it with a quiet wonder for the future.

### The Research Years: A Global Coastline

My academic journey became a path of both intellectual and geographical exploration. I traced the Pacific coastline of the Bay Area, marveling at the crystal waters of 17-Mile Drive, the Golden Gate Bridge draped in fog, and the serenity of Half Moon Bay. In the South, I witnessed the meeting of human ambition and nature near the Gulf of Mexico.

In San Diego, the beaches of La Jolla were home to the wild Pacific, while the harbor’s "Victory Kiss" statue added a touch of human warmth to the maritime landscape. Later, my footsteps crossed the Atlantic to the Mediterranean sun of Valencia and the Olympic waters of Barcelona. Perhaps most memorable was the journey to the southernmost point of the Florida Keys. In the waters made famous by Hemingway, I watched the sunset over the Gulf, feeling the same solitude and resilience found in *The Old Man and the Sea*.

### Career: The World in Tides

As I entered the professional world, the vistas grew even grander. I traveled north to the sublime, icy waters of Alaska; I headed south to gaze at seas as clear as emeralds in Hawaii; and in Cancun, the dreamlike "Tiffany Blue" of the Caribbean became a permanent fixture in my memory.

Eventually, I settled in a coastal city in the Pacific Northwest—a place cradled by winding, intricate arms of the sea. Whether looking out a window or walking the city streets, the breath of the ocean is a constant, grounding companion.

### Returning Home: The Wisdom of the Deep

Looking back, I realize my roots were by the sea, and my home today remains by the sea. The ocean is more than just scenery; it is a silent sage. It teaches us reverence for nature and the wisdom of "holding a hundred rivers"—the vastness of mind required to embrace all things.

My favorite photograph (above) captures a lone figure fishing by the shore. Against the crashing surf and the immense scale of the water, that posture of casting the line feels like a modern-day "Foolish Old Man Moving Mountains." It represents a spirit of unwavering perseverance—the courage to do what must be done, even when the task seems impossible. This is more than just fishing; it is a metaphor for life.
