Optimizing LLM/RL training for efficiency and performance is a complex endeavor that involves innovations across reinforcement learning algorithms, model architectures, and underlying infrastructure: ByteDance's DAPO, Ant Research's AReaL, MistralAI's Magistral, MiniMax's MiniMax-M1, and Google DeepMind's Gemini 2.5 models.

# I. Architectural Strategies

1.**Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning Systems**:

- **Decoupled Generation and Training**: Systems like AReaL fundamentally decouple LLM generation (rollout) from training, resolving issues of GPU underutilization and poor scalability inherent in synchronous systems. Synchronous systems suffer because generation must wait for the longest output in a batch to complete, leading to idle time and memory/IO-bound decoding.

- **Continuous Operation**: In asynchronous designs, rollout workers continuously generate outputs, and training workers update the model whenever a batch is collected. Model weights are synchronized without interrupting ongoing generations. This leads to significantly higher GPU utilization and up to **2.77x training speedup** compared to synchronous systems.

- **Interruptible Rollout Workers**: AReaL's rollout workers can be interrupted to load new model parameters, discarding and recomputing KV caches with the new weights. This introduces inconsistent policy versions within trajectories, which is addressed by algorithmic innovations.

2.**Hybrid Attention Mechanisms**:

- **MiniMax-M1** utilizes a **hybrid Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** architecture combined with Lightning Attention, an I/O-aware linear attention variant. This design alternates between a transformer block with softmax attention and multiple transnormer blocks with lightning attention.

- **Efficient Test-Time Compute Scaling: This architecture enables **efficient scaling of reasoning lengths to hundreds of thousands of tokens**, consuming significantly fewer FLOPs (e.g., 25% of DeepSeek R1's FLOPs at 100K tokens generation length). This translates to substantial efficiency gains during both inference and large-scale RL training.

- **Long Context Support**: MiniMax-M1 natively supports **up to 1 million tokens context length** and 80K tokens generation length, greatly exceeding other open-weight LRMs.

3.**Distributed Training Infrastructure**:

- TPUv5p Architecture: Gemini 2.5 models were the first to be trained on TPUv5p architecture, utilizing synchronous data-parallel training across multiple chip pods.

- **Slice-Granularity Elasticity**: Google's Pathways system for Gemini allows for automatic continuation of training with fewer TPU slices during localized hardware failures, reducing downtime from over 10 minutes to tens of seconds per interruption and maintaining high throughput (around 97%).

- **Split-Phase SDC Detection**: Lightweight deterministic replay and per-device intermediate checksums are used to quickly detect and localize data corruption errors, preventing long debugging and rollback delays.

# II. Data Strategies and Algorithmic Innovations

1.**Advanced Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**:

- **DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization)**: This algorithm is fully open-sourced and includes four key techniques:

    - **Clip-Higher**: Addresses entropy collapse by allowing higher clipping ranges for importance sampling ratios, promoting diversity and exploration of low-probability tokens.

    - **Dynamic Sampling**: Improves efficiency and stability by filtering out prompts where all outputs are either fully correct or fully incorrect (zero advantage), ensuring effective gradients in each batch.

    - **Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss**: Critical for long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) scenarios, it ensures that tokens within longer responses contribute proportionally to the overall loss, preventing unhealthy increases in entropy and response length from low-quality long samples.

    - **Overlong Reward Shaping**: Reduces reward noise and stabilizes training by using a soft length penalty for excessively long responses, rather than a punitive reward for truncation.

- **CISPO (Clipped IS-weight Policy Optimization)**: Introduced by MiniMax-M1, this novel algorithm clips importance sampling weights instead of token updates. This approach avoids dropping tokens, even those associated with large updates, maintains entropy for stable exploration, and leverages all tokens for gradient computations, achieving 2x speedup compared to DAPO.

- **Decoupled PPO Objective (AReaL)**: Disentangles the behavior policy (used for sampling trajectories) from a proximal policy (a recent target for regularization). This allows AReaL to effectively leverage samples generated from much older model versions without performance degradation, crucial for asynchronous training where batches may contain data from multiple policy versions.

2.Sophisticated Reward Shaping and Data Filtering:

- **Magistral's Reward System**: Evaluates model generations on **formatting, correctness, length, and language consistency**. It incorporates specific tag requirements, rule-based verifiers for math and code, soft length penalties, and a novel language consistency reward (based on a fastText classifier) to ensure multilingual reasoning without code-switching.

- **Eliminating Non-Diverse Groups**: Magistral filters out groups of generations where all responses are either entirely correct or entirely wrong (resulting in zero advantage), which otherwise contribute noise to gradients.

- **Curated and Filtered Datasets**:

    - **DAPO** transforms mathematical answers into integers for accurate rule-based reward signals.

    - **Magistral** employs a **two-stage difficulty filtering pipeline** for math problems, using both initial and stronger RL-trained models to curate "goldilocks" difficulty datasets, avoiding overly easy or too hard problems. For code, it processes contest data, generates tests, and ensures sufficient test agreement.

    - **MiniMax-M1** performs **continual pretraining** on a carefully curated, reasoning-intensive corpus with refined parsing, extensive deduplication, and increased proportion of STEM, code, and reasoning data. Its RL training data includes diverse verifiable (math, logical, competitive programming, software engineering) and non-verifiable (QA, creative writing) problems, with sandboxes for execution-based rewards in software engineering.

    - **Gemini 2.5** emphasizes **improved data quality** through enhanced filtering and deduplication for both pre-training and post-training datasets.

3.Adaptive Training and Curriculum Learning:

- **Dynamic Batching (AReaL)**: Uses a padding-free sequence packing strategy and a dynamic allocation algorithm to balance token distribution across micro-batches, maximizing GPU memory utilization and minimizing forward-backward passes for variable-length outputs.

- **Magistral's Staged Training**: Gradually increases data difficulty, maximal allowed completion length, and adjusts concurrent requests/batch sizes to manage KV-cache memory burden as model performance improves.

- **MiniMax-M1's Curriculum and Staged Length Scaling**: Starts RL training with reasoning-intensive tasks, then gradually mixes in general domain tasks to prevent catastrophic forgetting and foster generalization. It also uses a staged window expansion strategy for output length, transitioning based on empirical indicators like perplexity convergence.

- **Addressing Training Instability (MiniMax-M1)**: Detects repetitive patterns with early stopping, uses combined sample-level and token-level normalization to balance negative/positive sample gradients, and decreases gradient clipping thresholds.

4. Leveraging Model Capabilities and Distillation:

- **Thinking Models (Gemini 2.5)**: Models are trained with RL to use additional inference-time compute ("Thinking" stage) to arrive at more accurate answers, integrating this natively across all domains and allowing for controllable "thinking budgets".

- **Model-Assisted Quality Control**: Gemini 2.5 leverages the model itself to assist in data quality control during post-training.

- **Distillation for Smaller Models**: Gemini 2.5 and Magistral Small use distillation to transfer knowledge from larger teacher models, approximating the teacher's next token prediction distribution to improve quality and reduce serving cost for smaller models.

These strategies collectively contribute to faster training times, better utilization of hardware, and improved final model performance, particularly in complex reasoning and long-context tasks. For example, DAPO achieves 50 AIME points with 50% fewer steps than DeepSeek-R1, AReaL shows significant speedups and linear scaling efficiency, Magistral demonstrates substantial accuracy increases with pure RL, and MiniMax-M1 completes full RL training in three weeks for $0.53M, outperforming several state-of-the-art models in specific benchmarks.

# III. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Training Recipes/Algorithms

The core of LLM training often involves large-scale Reinforcement Learning, which aims to elicit complex reasoning and align model behavior. Each system introduces novel algorithmic modifications to enhance this process.

- **DAPO (Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization)**: This algorithm, fully open-sourced, is designed to overcome common issues like entropy collapse, reward noise, and training instability observed in traditional PPO/GRPO.

    - **Clip-Higher**: Promotes diversity and prevents entropy collapse by decoupling the lower ($\epsilon_{low}$) and higher ($\epsilon_{high}$) clipping ranges for the importance sampling ratio, specifically allowing low-probability "exploration" tokens more room to increase their probability. This enhances the policy's entropy and leads to more diverse samples.

    - **Dynamic Sampling**: Improves training efficiency and stability by filtering out prompts where all outputs are either fully correct (accuracy=1) or fully incorrect (accuracy=0), ensuring that each training batch contains samples with effective gradients. This helps maintain a consistent number of prompts with meaningful gradients and can even accelerate convergence.

    - **Token-Level Policy Gradient Loss**: Addresses challenges in long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by calculating loss at the token level rather than the sample level. This ensures that tokens within longer responses contribute proportionally to the overall loss, preventing unhealthy increases in entropy and response length from low-quality long samples.

    - **Overlong Reward Shaping**: Reduces reward noise and stabilizes training by introducing a soft length penalty for excessively long responses instead of a punitive reward for truncation. This helps the model avoid excessively long outputs without penalizing sound reasoning that happens to be lengthy.

    - **Rule-based Reward Modeling**: Directly uses the final accuracy of a verifiable task (e.g., math problems) as the outcome reward, transforming answers into integers for accurate rule-based signals and avoiding reward hacking.

- **AReaL (Asynchronous Reinforcement Learning System)**: Focuses on stabilizing RL training in an asynchronous environment where data staleness is a significant concern.

    - **Staleness-Aware Training**: Introduces a hyperparameter ($\eta$) to control the maximum permitted data staleness in each training batch. This is implemented by dynamically controlling the throughput of generation requests and prioritizing older trajectories from the data buffer.

    - **Decoupled PPO Objective**: Modifies the PPO algorithm by disentangling the behavior policy (used for sampling trajectories) from a proximal policy (a recent target for regularization). This crucial innovation allows AReaL to effectively leverage samples generated from much older model versions without performance degradation, which is vital for asynchronous systems where training batches may contain data from multiple policy versions. It also helps maintain algorithmic correctness when combining interruptible generation with policy updates.

    - **Rule-based Reward Function**: Similar to DAPO, it uses a rule-based reward that provides feedback on the final action, indicating answer correctness.

- **Magistral**: Builds upon Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with several modifications for improved stability and performance.

    - **Eliminating KL Divergence**: Removes the KL penalty term, as it found the policy to diverge substantially regardless, and maintaining a reference model copy incurs unjustified compute cost.

    - **Loss Normalization**: Normalizes loss by the total length of generations in a group to prevent length biases between responses within a single group.

    - **Advantage Normalization**: Estimates advantage for each token as the reward relative to the group mean, and further normalizes advantages within each minibatch.

    - **Relaxing Trust Region’s Upper Bound (Clip-Higher)**: Adopts the Clip-Higher strategy, similar to DAPO, by increasing $\epsilon_{high}$ (tuned between 0.26 and 0.28) to promote exploration of rare but insightful reasoning steps and prevent entropy collapse.

    - **Eliminating Non-Diverse Groups**: Filters out groups of generations where all responses are either entirely correct or entirely wrong (resulting in zero advantage) to reduce noise and ensure effective gradients in training batches.

    - **Sophisticated Reward Shaping**: Evaluates model generations on four axes: formatting, correctness, length, and language consistency.

        - **Formatting**: Rewards adherence to specific output structures (e.g., <think> tags, \boxed{} for math, markdown for code).

        - **Correctness**: Utilizes rule-based verifiers for math (SymPy) and execution-based unit tests for code.

        - **Length Penalty**: Applies a soft length penalty for excessively long responses.

        - **Language Consistency**: Incorporates a novel reward based on a fastText classifier to ensure all parts of a response (problem, thoughts, answer) use the same language, promoting multilingual reasoning without code-switching.

    - **Adaptive Training/Curriculum Learning**: Involves gradually increasing data difficulty, maximal allowed completion length, and adjusting concurrent requests/batch sizes as model performance improves to manage memory burden.

- **MiniMax-M1**: Introduces a novel RL algorithm and strategies to manage instability during scaling.

    - **CISPO (Clipped IS-weight Policy Optimization)**: A novel algorithm that clips importance sampling (IS) weights instead of token updates. This design avoids dropping tokens (even those associated with large updates), inherently maintains entropy for stable exploration, and leverages all tokens for gradient computations. It empirically achieves 2x speedup compared to DAPO. Similar to other recent works, it removes the KL penalty term and incorporates dynamic sampling and length penalty from DAPO.

    - **Early Truncation via Repetition Detection**: Implements a heuristic to halt generation if 3,000 consecutive tokens each have a probability above 0.99, which prevents pathologically long and repetitive responses and improves generation throughput.

    - **Hybrid Reward Models**: Uses rule-based verifiers for reasoning-intensive tasks (mathematical, logical, competitive programming, software engineering), and generative reward models for general domain tasks (QA, creative writing).

    - **Addressing Bias of Generative Reward Models**: Employs continuous online monitoring of length bias during RL training, triggering GenRM recalibration upon detecting detrimental length-seeking behavior. Supplements with RL-side techniques like reward shaping, value clipping, and normalization.

    - **Curriculum of Diverse Data**: Implements a carefully managed curriculum, starting with reasoning-intensive tasks with rule-based rewards and gradually mixing in general domain tasks. This prevents catastrophic forgetting of specialized skills while fostering broader generalization.

    - **Staged Length Scaling Strategy**: Gradually increases the output length (e.g., from 40K to 80K tokens) based on empirical indicators like perplexity convergence and the 99th percentile of output lengths approaching the current context window limit.

    - **Addressing Training Instability During Scaling**: Identifies pattern collapse (incoherent text in later stages of long-sequence training) caused by disproportionately large negative gradients. Solutions include repetitive pattern detection with early stopping, combined sample-level and token-level normalization, and decreasing gradient clipping thresholds and $\epsilon_{IS_high}$.

- **Gemini 2.5**: Focuses on post-training advancements including RL for model refinement.

    - **Thinking Models**: A key innovation where models are trained with RL to utilize additional inference-time compute ("Thinking" stage) to arrive at more accurate answers. This "Thinking" is natively integrated across all domains and allows for a controllable "thinking budget" to trade off performance and cost.

    - **Verifiable and Model-based Generative Rewards**: Emphasizes leveraging both verifiable rewards and sophisticated model-based generative rewards to provide scalable and nuanced feedback signals for RL.

    - **Model-Assisted Quality Control**: Leverages the model itself to assist in data quality control during post-training, enhancing efficiency.

    - **Algorithmic Enhancements for Stability**: Includes algorithmic changes to the RL process that have improved stability during longer training.

- **AReaL**: Similar to DAPO, AReaL is an RL system designed for existing LLMs. Its architectural innovation lies in its system design (decoupling generation from training) rather than in the LLM's internal structure itself.

- **Magistral**: Built on Mistral Medium 3 and Mistral Small 3 base models. Its contribution is in the RL framework and system architecture that enables efficient training of these existing models for reasoning.

- **MiniMax-M1**: Introduces a novel model architecture explicitly designed for efficiency and long-context reasoning.

    - **Lightning Attention**: Combines the MoE with Lightning Attention, an I/O-aware linear attention variant. The design alternates between a transformer block with softmax attention and multiple transnormer blocks with lightning attention. This enables efficient scaling of reasoning lengths to hundreds of thousands of tokens, consuming significantly fewer FLOPs (e.g., 25% of DeepSeek R1's FLOPs at 100K tokens generation length).

    - **Native Long Context**: This hybrid attention mechanism allows MiniMax-M1 to natively support up to 1 million tokens context length and 80K tokens generation length, greatly exceeding other open-weight LRMs.
